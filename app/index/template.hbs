 <h1 class="who-heading">Who we are</h1>

 <p class="about-us">The American Adventurer's Guild was founded to re-introduce some adventure back into our lives.
     We believe that Adventure, thrills, and freedom from boredom are not extras in life, but nessisary for happiness.
     For that reason we design adventures in the form of treasure hunts for our customers.....
     hunts for real treasure like bullion and gems, as well as artifacts and artwork.  Once you finish your experience,
      you will have something to keep forever that you can tell your friends and family about!</p>
